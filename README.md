# Hepathitis-C-Prediction-paper

This project aims to design and deploy an ML algorithm using Streamlit to predict if a patient has Hepatitis C.

The project has been done in collaboration with [Pauline Ornela Megne](https://github.com/MEGNEOrnela), [Binta Sow](https://github.com/BintaSOW1) and Abduljaleel Adejumo.

The app can be tested using this [link](https://nguefackuriel-hepathitis-c-pr-hepatitis-c-prediction-app-xdxi9n.streamlit.app/)

The paper related to this work has been accepted at the PanAfricaCon AI(PanAfrican Artificial Intelligence Conference) 2023 which will be held from October 4 to October 5, 2023 in Ethiopia.
